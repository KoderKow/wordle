The goal of this project was an exercise to programmatically help solve daily wordle puzzles. I initially started building an algorithm to help solve the puzzle as quickly as possible. To make the algorithm easy to use and not boot up R everytime, I implemented my workflow into this shiny app. This was a fun app to code up!
